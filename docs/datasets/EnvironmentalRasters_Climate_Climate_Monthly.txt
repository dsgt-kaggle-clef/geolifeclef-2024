The four montlhy GeoTIFF CHELSA time series climatic rasters covering Europe 2.1. The resolution is 30 arc seconds, i.e. approximately 1km. Coordinate system is WGS84.

The four variables are the precipitation (pr), maximum- (taxmax), minimum- (tasmin), and mean (tax) daily temperatures per month from january 2000 to june 2019. The temperature variables continue up to december 2019 but not precipitations. For instance, these rasters can be used to extract the climatic variable time series for each species observation based on its coordinates ("lon" and "lat" columns in Presence_only_train.csv and Presences_Absences_train.csv) and date ("year" and "dayOfYear" columns) and thus build models that may learn the relationship between the precise climatic history of a site and its species composition.

Procedure: We downloaded the global rasters version 2.1 from CHELSA (https://chelsa-climate.org/timeseries/) on november 2022 and cropped them to the extent of GLC2023 study area.
