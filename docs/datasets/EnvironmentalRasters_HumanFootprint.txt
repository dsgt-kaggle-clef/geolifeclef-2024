    • All rasters were reprojected from Mollweide (ESRI:54009) to WGS84 (EPSG:4326) and cropped in the area of interest. Bounding box in lon/lat is:
      min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = -32.26344, 26.63842, 35.58677, 72.18392

    • Detailed rasters were overlaid to create the standardized Human Footprint maps for all non-Antarctic land areas (i.e. summarized rasters). Consults [2] method for details.
