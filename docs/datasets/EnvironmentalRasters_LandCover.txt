Land cover (MODIS Terra+Aqua 500m)
- Land Cover product were downloaded at:
            https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/products/MCD12Q1/#overview

- .hdf files were merged thanks to gdal functions into a single multi-band geotiff, reprojected in WGS84 and cropped into bounding box of interest:
         min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = -32.26344, 26.63842, 35.58677, 72.18392


- Documentation for the MODIS Land Cover product is accessible at:
            https://www.bu.edu/lcsc/data-documentation/

- More specifically, the User Guide to Collection 6 MODIS Land Cover (MCD12Q1 and MCD12C1) Product accessible at:
            https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/101/MCD12_User_Guide_V6.pdf precises all 13 bands meaning.

    - We reproduced and adapted the summary Table 1 below. Be careful the band order is different from the hdf files    subdatasets order.
    - We advice the interested user to explore other tables from this pdf to interpret band values meaning.



Table 1: MCD12Q1 Science Data Sets. All bands are 8-bit unsigned and have a 255 fill value.
