This species presence-only data (Presence_only_train.csv) combines nearly five million observations from many datasets from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, www.gbif.org).

This data constitutes the largest piece of the training data, and covers all countries of our study area, but it has been sampled opportunistically (without standardized sampling protocol) leading to various sampling biases.

In addition to the main columns described in our Kaggle page (patchID, timeSerieID, speciesId, ), the file contains the following columns:
glcID: This is the row identifier.
datasetName: String, Name of the occcurrence source dataset in GBIF
observer: String, Name of the observer. This field was not always filled.
date: String, day of the survey in format yyyy-mm-dd. This field was not always filled, but may be fully recovered from the columns year (integer) and dayOfYear (integer between 1 and 366).
x_EPSG3035: Numeric, projected longitude coordinate in meters under projection LAEA Europe (EPSG:3035).
y_EPSG3035: Numeric, projected latitude coordinate in meters under projection LAEA Europe (EPSG:3035). For instance, it is recommended to compute euclidean distances between points based on these columns rather than the lon/lat columns (unprojected).
geoUncertaintyInM: Radius of uncertainty of the occurrence geolocation in meters.
gbifID: This column provides the occurrence id in GBIF.

The extraction of GBIF data was made on the 8th of november 2022:  https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.4ysfh4
