These archives contain 128x128 pixel jpeg files of RGB and NIR satellite patches (four bands) centered on our occurrences' locations.

The data was acquired through the Sentinel2 satellite program and pre-processed by Ecodatacube to produce raster files scaled to the entire european continent and projected into a unique CRS.
We filtered the data in order to pick patches from each spectral band corresponding to a location ((lon, lat) GPS coordinates) and a date matching that of our occurrences', and split them into JPEG files (RGB in 3-channels .jpeg files, NIR in single-channel .jpeg files). The images where converted from sentinel uint15 to uint8 by clippind data pixels values over 10000 and applying a gamma correction of 2.5.

Access: One first needs to download and decompress the files patchs_rgb.zip and patchs_nir.zip (located in /SatelliteImages/), generating the folders ./rgb and ./nir respectively. Each contains around 4 millions JPEG images organised in a folder tree of depth two. Each JPEG file is named with a numeric identifier called the "patchID" representing a unique combination of geolocation and year. To recover the RGB (resp. NIR) patch of a species observation, the patchID column of the occurrence CSV is the key to the file path with the rule '.../CD/AB/XXXXABCD.jpeg'. For instance, the path to RGB image of patchID=3018575 is "./rgb/75/85/3018575.jpeg". In the case where the patchID has less than 4 decimals, just add zeros before to get the folder path.

The extraction of EcodataCube data was made on the 10th of february 2023.
