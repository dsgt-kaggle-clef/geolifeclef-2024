These time series data (time_series_<band>.csv) combines over 20 years of satellite imagery across all of Europe thanks to Ecodatacube (https://stac.ecodatacube.eu/) which hosts many satellite view datasets.

The data was acquired through the Landsat satellite program and pre-processed by Ecodatacube to produce raster files scaled to the entire european continent and projected into a unique CRS.
We filtered the data in order to pick values from each spectral band corresponding to a location ((lon, lat) GPS coordinates) matching that of our occurrences', over a time window, and aggregated them in CSV files.

The time window considered for picking values is the quarter. Meaning each value corresponds to the mean value of Landsat's observations at the given location for 3 months prior to the given time, e.g. the value of a time series element under column 2012_4 will represent the mean value for that element from October 2012 to December 2012 included.

Each element is identified by a unique timeSerieID determined from the intersection of the occurrences' "patchID" and quarterly split "date" columns.

The files contain the following columns:
timeSerieID: The time series identifier.
<year>_<quarter>: Temporal window of study containing values in the range [0-255].


The extraction of EcodataCube data was made on the 3rd of march 2023.
